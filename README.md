# MATLAB-Linear-Motor-system-Simulation

In this repository, model based controller are designed for a linear motor system with some nonlinearity: 
Adaptive Robust Controller(ARC), Adaptive Controller(AC), Model Reference Adaptive Controller(MRAC) 
Direct Self-Tunning Regulator(DSTR)
indirect adaptive robust controller (IARC), integrated direct/indirect adaptive robust controller (DIARC)

For each controller, a matlab file is provided. ODE45 is used to simulate every discrete time interval to have a 
sampled simulation
